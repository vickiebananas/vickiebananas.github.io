excerpt: A few broken bones and a lot of time later, I finally got around to updating my site!

<p>Back in September, as I was minding my own business watching the youngest's little league baseball game, a tree randomly decided it wanted a piece of me. While I ended up with lots of broken bones, unable to sit, and in for three months of intensive rehab and a year of relearning how to walk, the tree ended up in worse shape as the strength of my big bones pulverized the tree upon impact.</p>

<p>Amidst the unbearable boredom of 90% of my energy going into growing new bones, I decided to redesign my website in the few and sparse bursts of energy I got as I began to feel better. So, voila! Welcome to my new site!</p>
