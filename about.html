          About Me
        </h2>
          <p>Hello there! My name is Victoria, I use they/them and she/her pronouns, and I’m an educator, scholar, and engineer. I’m passionate about accessibility, CS education, and social justice.</p>

          <p>I’m a proud Chapine (Guatemalan) born and raised in Chicago, now calling Rhode Island home. I’m currently a PhD student in the <a href="http://csls.sesp.northwestern.edu">Computer Science + Learning Sciences Program</a> at <a href="http://northwestern.edu">Northwestern U</a>. I am a proud <a href="https://www.brown.edu">Brunonian</a> with a <a href="https://education.brown.edu/academics/graduate/urban-education-policy-am">Master’s in Urban Education Policy</a> with a focus on Computer Science Education, as well as a Bachelor’s in <a href="http://cs.brown.edu">Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/hispanic-studies/">Hispanic Studies</a>. </p>

          <p>I am also a proud <a href="https://www.questbridge.org/scholars">QuestBridge Scholar</a>, <a href="http://technolochicas.org">Technolochica</a>, and a member of <a href="http://www.aspirations.org">NCWIT Aspirations</a>, among others. Outside of computer science and teaching, I enjoy reading, writing (poetry and short stories), and watching anything that’s suspense, thriller, or comedy.</p>

          Research Interests
        </h2>
          <p>My research interests explore systemic issues within computer science education, centering the experiences of Black, Disabled, Indigenous, and Latine/x students. Most recently, my research has focused on teaching and learning accessibility as well as unpacking how ableism is codified in the policies, practices, and pedagogies used in college CS courses.</p>

    			Why vickiebananas?
    		</h2>
    		<p>I've always liked bananas for their taste and our shared <a href="https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-dark-history-of-bananas-john-soluri">fraught Guatemalan background</a>. In high school, banana memes became my inside joke amongst friends, who covered my locker in pictures of them. I've never actually gone by Vickie or any variation of its spelling* but I liked the ring vickiebananas had to it, so I stuck with it. I chose the 'ie' spelling of it because my favorite teacher once addressed a note to me using that spelling.</p>

				<p>Older me would have gone with conchabananas, as Concha is the nickname for my middle name (Concepci&oacute;n) and a fun word with <a href="https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/concha">many varied meanings in Spanish</a>. But alas, I've built too large a realm as vickiebananas and so it shall remain.</p>

				<p>*Except for family and they spelled it with just an 'i' or 'y' and sometimes no 'c'.</p>
