# Contact Info

I go by @vickiebananas everywhere, though there are few platforms I actually use. I use Twitter personally and professionally under the same account because my work is informed by my experiences, my communities, and the communities I try to be an ally to.

## How to Reach me

You can find me as @vickiebananas on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/vickiebananas), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/vickiebananas), and [GitHub](http://github.com/vickiebananas) or [send me an email](mailto:vickiebananas@gmail.com).

## Why vickiebananas?
It started in high school, because I've always liked bananas and my friends once covered my locker in pictures of them. I've never actually gone by Vickie or any variation of its spelling* but I liked the ring vickiebananas had to it, so I stuck with it. I chose the 'ie' spelling of it because my favorite teacher once addressed a note to me using that spelling.

Older me would have gone with conchabananas, as Concha is the nickname for my middle name (Concepci&oacute;n) and a fun word with [way too many meanings in Spanish](https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/concha). But alas, I've built too large an empire as vickiebananas and so it shall remain.

*Except for family and they spelled it with just an 'i' or 'y' and sometimes no 'c'.
